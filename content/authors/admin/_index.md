I am a young statistician currently working as a Research Fellow in Biostatistics at the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine of [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/units/biostats). I obtained my PhD in Statistics in 2017 at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/institutes/rcs), then worked as a Junior Lecturer at the Faculty of Business and Economics of the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/do/en/home.html) teaching courses on Forecasting. 

I conduct research in mixed models and their applications. My current projects involve bootstrapping models with random effects and 
applications of in the field of survival analysis.
