<h3>Learner message</h3>
<p><em>Hi,</em></p>
<p><em>I’m trying to install everything on a PC (which is made available from my employer and dedicated to the course). Unfortunately, I’m having trouble already at the stage of installing the first packages. Here is what I get:</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; `install.packages(&quot;cowsay&quot;)`
`Warning in install.packages(&quot;cowsay&quot;):`
`lib = &quot;C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.1/library&quot;&#39; is not writable`
`Error in install.packages(&quot;cowsay&quot;) : unable to install packages`</code></pre>
<p><em>I suspect that this is because my company didn’t give me all the rights on this PC (if a folder is not writable)? If so, I will ask our IT division for help.</em></p>
<p><em>But I wanted to ask you first. I’m sorry that my computer knowledges are rather low and I’m unable to solve the problem by myself. Many thanks for your help in advance</em></p>

<h3>Response</h3>
<p>Hi <em>Learner</em>,</p>
<p>Don’t worry. As with any new software, it is quite common to encounter problems during the first installation, specially if you are on a computer without full admin rights.</p>
<p>Of course you could ask for the administrative rights, but I imagine that an easier alternative is to re-install <code>R</code> and its packages in a directory where you have full reading and writing rights.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you go through this route, I suggest to un-install <code>R</code> by executing <code>C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.1/unins000.exe</code>. Choose the prompts to erase all files and cache.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to reinstall <code>R</code> with an installer you have downloaded from CRAN.</p></li>
<li><p>During the installation process, <strong>when prompted about the installation directory</strong>, choose a folder where you have the writing permissions, for example: <code>C:/Users/&lt;yourusername&gt;/Documents/R/</code> (where you’d replace <code>&lt;yourusername&gt;</code> by your username in the computer)</p></li>
<li><p>Once installation finishes, start <code>R</code> and try installing the package again.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Do not hesitate to contact me or book a one-to-one session should you encounter any problems with this method. Good luck!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> I don’t know if this response is way too easy. Another option would be adapting the following post</p>
